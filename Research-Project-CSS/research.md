##Responsive vs. mobile-first design

_"A responsive site displays identical content across all devices while conforming to the container with which a user interacts. From a user experience standpoint, mobile design should still be “responsive” in the way images, text and menus work together in a kinetic chain to fit the device they’re viewed on. Likewise, they should adapt to the user’s behaviors."_
